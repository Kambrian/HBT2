MPI version

-------------------
snapshot contain multiple arrays for separate/efficient load; maybe not a problem/even a benefit to use particle cell with MPI.

custom allocator for vectors 

use shallow_list for subhalo particles as well? or use vector for MemberTable as well.

unify snapshot template/base class (include a common header containing snapnum, Hz, scalefactor)
make tree accept snapshot class

fix non-POD issue with HDF save.

Future: 
shared_ptr
