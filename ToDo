* check Orphan branch output
* update default params: Precision=0.995, OneLoop=False? (or set mass limit above which to do oneloop main), Refine=false?

  Effect of optimization:
	Sampling/Refine: does not affect mass/tracks significantly; improves scaling/speed significantly
	OneLoopCentralUnbind: leads to less tracks (less orphans and more good ones, less newbirth since more good progenitors). improves speed moderately.
	relaxed MassPrecision: leads to more tracks and more mass. improves speed moderately.

advise to remove temporary tracks that die before infall?

Add Virial/Vmax: test bound vs all: how much does the virial mass/radius differ? is the density profile still NFW? is it correct with the mass/concentration parameters?

one loop unbinding for main? (note these are only intended to remove fake haloes)

Run on major merger and satellite infall

Reorganize SubSnap output: sort subhalos to move disrupted ones to the end; add number_of_live_subs; add live_sub_properties block; add TrackIdToIndex block.

Add Doc: user's manual.

Add hosthalo virial properties using all particles

Add support for other simulation/group format

Mask particles to decide most-bound

separate particles from subhaloes in output. also output each property individually?
--------
remove id=-1 from pidhash: do not allow this. just exit, or throw exception

analysis routines/check compare

segregate the effect of MassPrecision (run one HBT1 with 0.9 mass prec)
-------------------
snapshot contain multiple arrays for separate/efficient load; maybe not a problem/even a benefit to use particle cell with MPI.

custom allocator for vectors 

use shallow_list for subhalo particles as well? or use vector for MemberTable as well.

unify snapshot template/base class (include a common header containing snapnum, Hz, scalefactor)
make tree accept snapshot class

fix non-POD issue with HDF save.
-------------------
Future: 
shared_ptr

support variable particle mass

extend to gas and stars
