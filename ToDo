Better parallelization/Minisnapshot

Add Virial/Vmax: test bound vs all: how much does the virial mass/radius differ? is the density profile still NFW? is it correct with the mass/concentration parameters?

Run on major merger and satellite infall

sort subhalos to move disrupted ones to the end; add number_of_live_subs; add live_sub_properties block: virial, rmax/vmax, rhalf, rpoisson...
--------
remove id=-1 from pidhash: do not allow this. just exit, or throw exception

analysis routines/check compare

segregate the effect of MassPrecision (run one HBT1 with 0.9 mass prec)

MPI version

-------------------
snapshot contain multiple arrays for separate/efficient load; maybe not a problem/even a benefit to use particle cell with MPI.

custom allocator for vectors 

use shallow_list for subhalo particles as well? or use vector for MemberTable as well.

unify snapshot template/base class (include a common header containing snapnum, Hz, scalefactor)
make tree accept snapshot class

fix non-POD issue with HDF save.
-------------------
Future: 
shared_ptr
