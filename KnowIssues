- There could be significant performance degradation on an overloaded system. (OpenMP version)

  This is probably caused by the compiler (g++) not optimizing the code well in case of system overload. Have to rely on resource allocation from a batch job scheduler (e.g., LSF). Or make sure the system cpus are not exceeded if you are running on an interactive machine. 
  
- PlatformMPI on cosma may cause MPI_Mem_Alloc out of memory error
  
  This is a problem with the platformMPI configuration on cosma. Setting `MPI_RANKMEMSIZE` environment variable to a large number may overcome the problem, e.g.,
  
      export MPI_RANKMEMSIZE=1000000000
  
  in bash, or
  
      setenv MPI_RANKMEMSIZE 1000000000
  
  in csh.
