- There could be significant performance degradation on an overloaded system. (OpenMP version)

  This is probably caused by the compiler (g++) failing to optimize the code well in case of system overload. Have to rely on resource allocation from a batch job scheduler (e.g., LSF). Or make sure the cpus are not overloaded if you are running on an interactive machine.
