- There could be significant performance degradation on an overloaded system. (OpenMP version)

  This is probably caused by the compiler (g++) failing to optimize the code well in case of system overload. Have to rely on resource allocation from a batch job scheduler (e.g., LSF). Or make sure the cpus are not overloaded if you are running on an interactive machine. 
  
- Very poor parallel performance of jing_io when compiled with gfortran on uv35. The IO was almost serial or even worse.

  Using intel fortran instead of gfortran solves the problem, i.e., by setting 
    FC=ifort
    FTNLIB=-lifport -lifcore
  in Makefile.inc. The old intel c++ compiler (2013) was not built with full c++11 support while the newest intel c++ compiler (2017) seems to have a bug in parallelizing the IO. Fortunately we can use ifort together with g++. 
  
- Fortran file format error when run on 6113 on a4700, compiled with gfortran

  Again intel fortran solves the problem.
